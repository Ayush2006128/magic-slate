# Privacy Policy for Magic Slate

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Welcome to Magic Slate! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.

## Collection of Your Information

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### Data You Provide to Us
We may collect information you provide directly to us, such as:
- Images or drawings you create or upload to the canvas (e.g., doodles, handwritten equations). These are processed by AI models to provide features like doodle enhancement and equation solving. This data is sent to third-party AI service providers (e.g., Google for Genkit AI features) for processing and is subject to their privacy policies. We do not store this data long-term on our servers beyond what is necessary for the immediate processing and display of results.
- Text prompts you provide for AI features (e.g., artwork style for doodle enhancement). This data is also sent to third-party AI service providers.
- Your Google AI API Key: If you provide your own API key for Google AI services, it is stored encrypted within your browser's cookies. This key is used to make requests to Google AI services on your behalf.

### Automatically Collected Information
Our application does not automatically collect personal information like your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, or the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Application. We may use cookies as described below.

## Use of Your Information

Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:
- Operate and manage the Application.
- Enable AI-powered features such as doodle enhancement and equation solving by transmitting your input (images, text, and your API key) to third-party AI models.
- Improve our Application and services.
- Respond to user inquiries and offer support.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties except as described herein.
- **AI Service Providers:** As mentioned, data you provide for AI features (doodles, equations, prompts) and your API key is sent to third-party AI service providers (e.g., Google) to enable these features. Their use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies.
- **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Application, or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

## Tracking Technologies

### Cookies
We use cookies for essential application functionality, such as:
- Remembering if you have completed the app tour (`magicSlateTourFinished`).
- Storing your encrypted Google AI API key and related cryptographic details (`genkitUserApiKeyEncrypted`, `genkitUserApiKeyIV`, `genkitUserApiKeySalt`) if you provide one.
Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features of our Application, notably the AI features if your API key cookie is removed.

## Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. Your Google AI API key, if provided, is encrypted using your browser's Web Crypto API (AES-GCM) before being stored in cookies. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Storing API keys in browser cookies, even encrypted, carries inherent security risks (e.g., XSS attacks). For production applications, more secure server-side key management is typically recommended.

## Open Source Nature

Magic Slate is an open-source application. This means its source code is publicly available for review and contribution. While this promotes transparency, it also means the code, including any client-side logic for handling data (like API key encryption), can be inspected. We encourage users to be aware of this and to understand the data handling practices described in this policy. The open-source nature does not change our commitment to the privacy practices outlined herein.

## Third-Party Websites

The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.

## Policy for Children

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
